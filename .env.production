# ============ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST ============
#
# Before deploying to production:
#
# 1. Backend URL
#    [ ] Replace REACT_APP_API_URL with your production backend URL
#    [ ] Make sure backend is deployed and accessible
#    [ ] Test backend /health endpoint
#
# 2. Stripe Configuration
#    [ ] For testing: Use Stripe TEST keys (pk_test_*)
#    [ ] For live payments: Switch to LIVE keys (pk_live_*)
#    [ ] Configure Stripe webhooks in dashboard
#    [ ] Test payment flow end-to-end
#
# 3. Analytics & Tracking
#    [ ] Add Google Analytics tracking ID (optional)
#    [ ] Add Mixpanel token (optional)
#    [ ] Add Sentry DSN for error tracking (recommended)
#
# 4. Security
#    [ ] Verify GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
#    [ ] Verify NODE_ENV=production
#    [ ] Verify debug flags are disabled
#    [ ] Test CORS configuration
#    [ ] Enable HTTPS (SSL certificate)
#
# 5. Build & Deploy
#    [ ] Run: npm run build
#    [ ] Test production build locally: serve -s build
#    [ ] Deploy to hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
#    [ ] Configure custom domain (optional)
#
# 6. Post-Deployment Testing
#    [ ] Test user registration
#    [ ] Test user login
#    [ ] Test screenshot capture
#    [ ] Test subscription upgrade (with test card)
#    [ ] Test all pages load correctly
#    [ ] Check browser console for errors
#    [ ] Verify analytics tracking works
#
# ============ DEPLOYMENT PLATFORMS ============
#
# Recommended hosting for React frontend:
#
# 1. Vercel (Recommended) ⭐
#    - Perfect for React apps
#    - Automatic HTTPS
#    - Global CDN
#    - Free tier available
#    - https://vercel.com
#
# 2. Netlify
#    - Similar to Vercel
#    - Great for static sites
#    - Free tier available
#    - https://netlify.com
#
# 3. Cloudflare Pages
#    - Fast global CDN
#    - Generous free tier
#    - https://pages.cloudflare.com
#
# 4. AWS Amplify
#    - Full AWS integration
#    - More complex setup
#    - https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/
#
# ============ ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE INJECTION ============
#
# Most hosting platforms allow you to set environment variables in their dashboard:
#
# Vercel:
# 1. Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables
# 2. Add each REACT_APP_* variable
# 3. Set for "Production" environment
# 4. Redeploy
#
# Netlify:
# 1. Go to Site Settings → Environment Variables
# 2. Add each REACT_APP_* variable
# 3. Redeploy
#
# This is MORE SECURE than committing .env.production with real keys!
#
# ============ IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES ============
#
# 1. NEVER commit Stripe SECRET keys (sk_*)
#    ✅ Publishable keys (pk_*) are safe to commit
#    ❌ Secret keys (sk_*) must NEVER be in frontend
#
# 2. Source maps
#    GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false prevents exposing your source code
#
# 3. API keys in frontend
#    Remember: ALL REACT_APP_* variables are PUBLIC
#    They're embedded in the JavaScript bundle
#    Users can see them in browser DevTools
#    Only put PUBLISHABLE keys here (never secrets)
#
# 4. Backend security
#    All sensitive operations must be on backend
#    Frontend just calls API endpoints
#    Backend validates everything
